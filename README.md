GitMerge-for-Unity
==================

A Unity plugin which allows you to merge scene and prefab files when using git.
More information: http://flashg.github.io/GitMerge-for-Unity/

### This tool does not work in Unity's current state (version 5 - now)...

...and it will not do so until a small change in scene serialization will be reverted in Unity.
Please refer to issue #17.
